PacMen Exercise

<img src= "PacMan1.png" width= '100' />


## Description 
This is an exercise where there are two buttons: Create PacMan and Start Game. When you click "create PacMan" a new PacMan image appears in a random place in the page. When you click "Start Game" all the PacMen created start to move at random speeds and in random directions. When a PacMan hits a wall, it bounces back. I used JavaScript to code the movement of the PacMen. 

## How to Run
Open the html file in any browser


## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Future improvements include:
  - Erasing all the PacMen. 
  - Generating PacMen of different colors
